# JavaScript game
##### An attempt at replicating [Dark Blue](www.lessmilk.com/games/10) a side scrolling in browser game which uses JS, HTML, CSS to accomplish basic player function. Built with direciton and theory from Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke.

# TO DO:

- build out more levels [currently using Marijn's levels]
- encapsulate level and player attributes in seperate files
- style home page to be more appealing
